i want to create a self-service portal for insuarance .

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Users should be able to create an account, log in, and access their policy details.
Submit a claim with required fields (policy number, type of claim, date, etc.).
Upload supporting documents (e.g., photos, receipts).
View claim status 
Integration with the insurance system to sync claim data.
Notifications for claim updates via email/SMS.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
 Security and encryption for personal and claim data.
 Scalability to handle peak times during catastrophic events.
 Fast response time for UI actions and background processes.


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Frontend: Web-based user interface (mobile-responsive), built using a technology like React or Angular.
Backend: Microservices architecture to handle user sessions, claims, and document uploads. The backend would connect to the main insurance system through APIs.
Integration: RESTful or SOAP APIs for data exchange between the portal and the main insurance system.
Database: A database to store user and claims information. SQL or NoSQL depending on needs.

SECURITY

 Use SSL encryption.
  Authentication through  JWT 
 Multi-factor authentication for login

WORKFLOW DESIGN
1. User Registration and Login
User creates an account or logs in using existing credentials from the main insurance system.
   
2.  Claim Submission
User selects policy, inputs claim details, uploads documents, and submits.
Backend validates inputs and stores claim in the portal database.
A request is sent to the main insurance system, creating a record in the insurance application.
 

3. Claim Processing
Claim data is synced between the portal and the main system.
The insurance team processes the claim, updating the status in the main system.
Status updates are reflected in the portal.
 
4. Claim Status Updates
User can log in to track claim progress, check for any requests (additional documents or info), and receive notifications.


Sample Screen Designs (UI/UX Screens):
  
Login Screen: A simple login form with email/password and an option for account recovery.
Dashboard: Displays the user's policies and the current status of active claims.
Claim Submission Form: Form fields for selecting policy, inputting claim type, date, description, and document upload (drag-and-drop interface).
Claim Status Page: A timeline or progress bar showing each stage of the claim (e.g., Submitted, In Review, Approved/Denied).
Notifications: Popup or email settings allowing users to customize alerts for status changes.


Backend: Build the API layer to handle form submissions, file uploads, and communication with the insurance system.
